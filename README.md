# Code-of-Conduct

When you join Developer Student Club MAIT, you’re joining a community. And like all growing communities, a couple of ground rules about expected behavior are good for everybody. These guidelines cover both online (e.g. mailing lists, telegram group, virtual meetings) and offline (e.g. in-person meetups) behavior. This code of conduct applies to all members of this community and all new members are informed to make sure they have read it. 

## 1. Core Values 
- **Commitment** - We are required to undertake our best to commit to the course of the community but fully participating in our activities. Join in on discussions, show up for in-person/virtual meetings regularly. 

- **Collaboration** - Work together! We can learn tons from one another. Share knowledge, and help one another out. 
 
- **Respect** - We are all required to respect everyone who is part of this community and every other person invited to be a part of the community during our activities. Remember to be respectful and constructive together with your communication to fellow members within the telegram group. don't get into flame wars, make personal attacks, vent, or rant unconstructively. Everyone should take responsibility for the community and take the initiative to diffuse tension and stop a negative discussion as early as possible. Property belonging to people like laptops, phones, and bags must be respected. 
 
- **Honesty and Integrity** - We expect this to be observed altogether dimensions. In addressing others, performing tasks, and handling responsibilities during every event conducted by DSC MAIT 
 
- **Etiquette for virtual discussions** - Don’t send messages to an enormous list that only has to head to one person. Keep off-topic conversations to a minimum. Don’t be spammy by advertising or promoting brands that are completely unrelated to the cause of the DSC MAIT Community. 
 
- **Step down considerately** - If you've got some kind of responsibility in your community, bear in mind your own constraints. If you recognize that a new internship or personal situation will limit your time, find someone who can take over for you and transfer the relevant information (contacts, passwords, etc.) to the DSC Lead for a smooth transition. 

## 2. Decision-making 
We are a community and thus any decision made affects the entire community. Let it be made clear that anyone within the community can give suggestions for decisions and can only be applicable if approved by the DSC Lead and core team of the community. It'll be against the code of conduct for a decision affecting the entire community to be made and implemented without consulting the DSC Lead. 

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

- In-person or online harassment of any kind, including but not limited to: 
  - Sustained disruption of talks or other events Offensive verbal language 
  - A verbal language that reinforces social structures of domination 
  - Physical or cyber threats 
- Any sort of harassment, trolling or bullying shall not be tolerated and may result in one losing their DSC MAIT membership. 
- Any disrespect among the general body of the DSC community or any member of DSC MAIT won't be tolerated. 
- Any kind of immoral activity among the DSC community won't be tolerated and be seriously addressed. If a member engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the DSC Lead may take any action, including warning or expelling the member from the community or blocking the member from participating online 

## 4. Reporting
Freedom of expression should be respected in this community. One can question, raise any issue or report any matter without worrying about retaliation. Any incident of unacceptable behavior can be mailed directly to the DSC Lead at deepikarana500@gmail.com However, all this should be done in a disciplined manner. 

## 5. Conflicts of Interest
